# C_Project
Project on C programming
This project is based on base64 encoding scheme.This project has one static library containing the Encoding and Decoding object files and encode the text of the given file to decoded format and then can be decoded to text again with Decoding function.

Base64 technique uses 64 characters to decode the text.26 capital alphabets,26 lowercase letters , 10 digits and +,/ characaters. It also used '=' character for padding when lastset of bits do not contain 6 bits.
